 Multiple Disease Detection

This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-provided data.

## Features

- **Breast Cancer Detection:** Predicts the presence of breast cancer.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Assesses the risk of diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Evaluates the probability of heart disease.
